"""The WiFi screen and the nmcli parsing under it.

No network is touched here. What is tested is the part that is wrong quietly:
parsing nmcli's terse output, turning its errors into something readable on a
five inch panel, and the row arithmetic that turns a tap into a network.

That last one has a precedent. PAIR_ROW0 carries a comment saying it must
track the renderer rather than be guessed at, because a tap landing one row
out selects the wrong device and looks like a touchscreen fault. WIFI_ROW0 is
the same constant for the same reason, and this asserts it against the
renderer instead of trusting it.
