"""What the deck remembers when it is restarted.

The deck is switched off by removing its power, so "remembered" has to mean
written to the card, not written to the page cache. Two faults hide here and
neither shows up in a single run:

  * the state is never written, and the defaults quietly stand;
  * the state is written but not flushed, so a clean restart restores it and
    a power cut does not — which reads as "sometimes it works".

This starts the real application, changes something, lets it exit, starts it
again against the same state file, and looks at the screen. The second fault
is addressed by fsync in _save_state; it cannot be reproduced here without
cutting power, so what this covers is the first, plus the read-back path.
