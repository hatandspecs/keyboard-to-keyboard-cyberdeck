"""Arrow-key menu navigation and live menu state, driven through a real pty.

The harness runs with TERM=xterm, where keypad(True) puts the terminal into
application cursor mode: Down is \x1bOB, not \x1b[B. The deck itself runs on
the Linux console, where kcud1 is \x1b[B. ncurses resolves both from terminfo;
the test has to send whatever its own TERM specifies.
