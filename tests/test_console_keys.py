"""Keys as the framebuffer console delivers them, not as xterm does.

Every other pty test runs under TERM=xterm, because that is what a development
machine and an SSH session provide. The deck does not run under xterm. It runs
on tty1 as TERM=linux, and the two terminfo entries disagree about what some
keystrokes mean:

    linux:  kspd=^Z       ncurses consumes byte 26, returns KEY_SUSPEND (407)
    xterm:  no kspd       byte 26 arrives as 26

So a handler written as `ch == 26` works over SSH, passes the whole test
suite, and does nothing at all on the panel. That is how Ctrl-Z shipped
broken: the undo was correct, the dispatch never reached it.

kspd is the only capability in the linux entry that captures a control byte
the deck uses (kbs=^? is the other, and backspace already accepts it), so the
exposure is small — but it is invisible without running under the real
terminal type, which is what this file does.

Function keys differ too, which is why the sequences below are read from
terminfo rather than written as literals. Hard-coding xterm's \\E[15~ into a
TERM=linux run produces a test that fails for the wrong reason.
