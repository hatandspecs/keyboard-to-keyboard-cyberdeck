"""The pairing screen: what it shows, and that it degrades off a deck.

The BlueZ conversation itself cannot be tested here — there is no way to
synthesise "a keyboard bonded successfully" — so `tools/bt_agent_probe.py`
measured the one property the design rests on instead, against real hardware
(design_doc.md section 16). What IS testable is everything around it: the
screen, the device model, and the refusal on a machine that cannot pair.

That refusal matters as much as the feature. The application runs on ordinary
laptops, and `btpair` needs Linux, BlueZ and PyGObject. None of it may be
imported at startup, and asking for it where it cannot work has to produce a
sentence rather than a traceback.
