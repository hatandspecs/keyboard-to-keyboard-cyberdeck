"""The touchscreen, driven from synthetic evdev events.

No hardware is needed and none should be: the protocol is a fixed-size struct
and a handful of codes, so feeding it bytes exercises the same path a finger
does. What cannot be tested here is whether the panel is wired to the driver,
which is why the hardware check in design_doc.md section 16 exists.

The device found on the deck reports multitouch protocol type B — slots and
tracking IDs — but scrolling needs one finger's Y position and nothing else,
so only BTN_TOUCH and ABS_MT_POSITION_Y are consumed. Ignoring the rest is
deliberate: a second finger cannot start a second drag.
