"""Starting up before fldigi does — which is every power-on of the deck.

The terminal's unit is ordered `After=cyberdeck-fldigi.service`, and that
means only that the fldigi process has been spawned. Under Xvfb on a 3A+ it
takes seconds longer to open its XML-RPC port, and the terminal is drawing a
screen well before then. Everything the deck does to the radio at startup used
to sit behind a single `if self.fldigi.connected` in __init__, evaluated once,
with nothing to retry it.

Two faults came out of that, and the second is why it never recovered on its
own:

  * the remembered mode was never sent, so the deck came up in whatever mode
    fldigi itself had saved — CW on a stock configuration;
  * ten seconds later the saver noticed that CW differed from the nothing it
    had recorded at startup, and wrote CW over the remembered mode. Every
    power cycle destroyed the setting again.

Neither is visible from a restart of the terminal alone, because fldigi is
already up by then. That is exactly why this uses a stand-in fldigi whose
moment of arrival the test chooses.
