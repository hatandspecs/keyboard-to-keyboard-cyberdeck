"""Pairing a Bluetooth keyboard from the deck, with no SSH.

The crux is not the interface. An LE keyboard will not deliver input over an
unbonded link, and bonding needs a passkey **displayed by the host and typed
on the keyboard being paired** — which is why a `NoInputNoOutput` agent fails
and `KeyboardDisplay` works. The deck has a screen and the keyboard being
paired types, so SSH was never fundamentally required, only convenient at 2am.

What makes this delicate is lifetime. BlueZ tracks an agent, and discovery,
**per D-Bus connection**. The original pairing script ran each `bluetoothctl`
command as its own process, so the agent it registered was gone before pairing
began: BlueZ had nowhere to send the passkey and the script reported success
on a keyboard that could not type a character. The same rule was demonstrated
from the command line later — `StartDiscovery` in one `busctl` call and
`StopDiscovery` in another fails with "No discovery started".

So everything here happens on ONE connection held open for the whole
operation, and `tools/bt_agent_probe.py` measured that this works: an agent
registered by the deck as its own user survived a thirty-second discovery
(design_doc.md section 16).

Nothing in this module is imported until the operator asks to pair. `gi` is
not present on every machine the terminal runs on — it is a Linux, BlueZ and
PyGObject stack, and the application is also run on laptops and on machines
with no Bluetooth at all — so the import is deliberately late and its failure
is a message rather than a traceback.
