The only thing on the screen: a status line, the conversation, and what is

        RTTY is the mode that needs this. Baudot has no error detection at

        fits the frame decodes as a character. When PTT drops the receiver
        unmutes and the AGC recovers, and the modem turns that transient into
        text. It is real audio and fldigi is right to decode it; it is simply
        not anybody's transmission. The tail of our own echo lands in the same
        window.

        A fixed timer is the obvious instrument and the wrong one on its own.
        Long enough to cover the transient on a quiet band is long enough to
        swallow the opening characters of a fast reply in a contest, and a
        timer cannot tell those apart. So the timer is only the floor:

        * below ``RX_HOLD_MS``, always discard — at PTT drop even the quality
          metric is still settling, so there is nothing trustworthy to gate on;
        * after that, discard until the modem reports a real signal on two
          consecutive polls. A decaying transient does not sustain; a
          correspondent answering does;
        * give up at ``RX_HOLD_MAX_MS``, so a band with nothing on it returns
          to normal behavior instead of blanking indefinitely.

        ``RX_HOLD_MAX_MS = 0`` disables the quality gate and leaves exactly the
        fixed ``RX_HOLD_MS`` window, which is what this did before.

        Nothing is cleared. ``poll_rx()`` drains and this discards, so the
        chunk delivered on release holds only what arrived since the last
        poll. Calling ``clear_rx()`` on release would throw away the opening
