"""WiFi, through nmcli.

The deck's networks are NetworkManager keyfiles, written into the card by
`build_deck_image.sh` from `deck.secrets`. That is the right arrangement for a
deck that has just been flashed and the wrong one everywhere else: joining a
network at a park, or a friend's house, or a hotel, meant editing a file on a
laptop and reflashing. This is the same job done from the panel.

`nmcli` rather than NetworkManager's D-Bus API, which is the opposite of the
choice `btpair` made. Bluetooth pairing needed a D-Bus connection held open
for the whole operation, because BlueZ ties an agent's lifetime to the
connection that registered it — a subprocess per command could not work, and
that defect was what made the first pairing script report success on a
keyboard that could not type. WiFi has no agent and no such requirement. Each
of these commands is complete in itself, so the simple mechanism is also the
correct one, and it keeps the module importable on a machine with no
PyGObject.

Nothing here blocks the interface. Joining a network takes seconds to tens of
seconds, and the terminal polls every 200 ms; a synchronous call would freeze
the panel mid-contact. Long operations are `Op` objects, started and then
asked whether they have finished.
