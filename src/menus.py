"""Full-screen menus, selected by a single key (docs/design_doc.md §5.8).

No pointer, no cursor to move, no nesting deeper than two: a menu is a list of
labeled keys and pressing one does the thing. That is the fastest interface
on a keyboard and the only sane one on a console with no mouse.

The structure is data and the rendering is a pure function, so both can be
tested at 50, 66, 80 and 100 columns without a terminal. What each item *does*
is wired up in cyberdeck.py, because only that knows about fldigi.
