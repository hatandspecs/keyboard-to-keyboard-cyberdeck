"""The panel's touchscreen, read directly from evdev.

Touch was left out of the original design on the assumption that using it
meant running X (design_doc.md section 15.2). It does not. The controller
enumerates as an ordinary input device and a drag is a handful of integers
read from a character device, so the console keeps its premise — no pointer,
nothing to click — while gaining the one gesture that is awkward from a
keyboard during a contact.

What this deliberately is not: a pointer. There is no cursor and nothing
follows the finger. Two gestures exist and no more:

* a vertical **drag** on the transcript scrolls it — a gesture on content,
  not an instruction to a widget;
* a **tap** chooses a row on the pairing screen, which is the one screen that
  has to be usable when no keyboard is paired yet and therefore cannot ask
  for a keypress.

Everywhere else a tap is discarded. Reporting taps as cells rather than acting
on them is what keeps that decision with the screen rather than here.

Hardware, as found on the deck (2026-09-22):

    10-0038 generic ft5x06      FocalTech FT5x06 at i2c address 0x38
    PROP=2                      INPUT_PROP_DIRECT — a touchscreen, not a pad
    ABS_MT_SLOT/POSITION_X/Y    multitouch protocol type B
    /dev/input/event1           crw-rw---- root input, and deck is in input

Coordinates arrive as panel pixels and the character grid divides them
exactly: 800x480 at a 12x24 font is 66x20, so a row is 24 pixels with nothing
left over. No calibration step and no scaling.

    includes two devices permanently present and neither of them a keyboard:

        C-Media USB Audio Device   the radio's codec — USB audio exposes HID

    The same shape of false positive appears on an ordinary laptop, where
    power buttons, hotkey blocks and even the PC speaker carry `kbd` with an
    empty key bitmap.

    What separates them is what they can type. A keyboard reports the whole
    top letter row; a volume rocker or a CEC remote does not.

    Read from /proc rather than asked of BlueZ on purpose: a USB keyboard is a
    perfectly good answer and BlueZ knows nothing about it, and this has to
    work where BlueZ is not installed at all.
