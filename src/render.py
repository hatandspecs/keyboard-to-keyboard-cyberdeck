"""Turning a Session into lines of text.

Kept free of curses so the layout can be tested at any width without a
terminal, which matters because the grid is not fixed: the 800x480 panel gives
66x20 at the proposed 12x24 console font, 80x24 at 10x20, and 50x15 at 16x32
(docs/design_doc.md §3.3). Everything here adapts to the width it is given rather
than assuming one.

A rendered line is a list of (text, kind) segments. The kind names an
appearance — "dim", "bright", "reverse" — and the curses layer decides what
that means in the current color scheme. Nothing here knows about color.
