# A keyboard-to-keyboard cyberdeck

**KD3CCO**

A single-purpose HF text terminal for \$68

---

<!-- _class: evidence -->

# My desk is 20 by 14 inches, and a laptop does not fit on it

![](img/the-deck-on-the-desk.jpg)

<span class="caption">The whole station: the deck, a Bluetooth keyboard, and the FTX-1 just out of frame.</span>

---

# Every digital-mode program assumes a waterfall, a mouse, and a bunch of cluttered windows

That is the right design for tuning and for contesting.

It is the wrong design for **having a conversation** — which is what RTTY, PSK31 and Olivia were built for, and the part I actually wanted.

Opening a laptop to operate also feels like clocking back in.

<!-- _class: evidence -->

# So the screen shows the conversation, and not much else

<span class="caption">66 columns by 20 rows. A status line, the conversation, what you are typing, and the keys that do something.</span>

<!-- _class: panel -->

# It is a \$25 computer behind a \$43 panel, on standoffs that are also the stand

Raspberry Pi 3A+ · Waveshare 5-inch DSI panel · 66 × 20 characters of text.

It ran like this to begin with — the panel plugs into a ribbon cable, the standoffs hold it up, and nothing in the build is beyond a screwdriver.

</div>

<span class="caption">Parametric, so the panel, the Pi and the standoff heights are numbers at the top of the file rather than measurements baked into a mesh — which matters when the thing you are modeling is already built and cannot change to suit the model.</span>

<!-- _class: panel -->

# KD3CCP printed the case and it came out great

It does two jobs. It **encloses the electronics** — the Pi, the back of the panel, and the ribbon cable between them, which was the most exposed thing on the bare build. And it is **a stable stand**.


**Twelve days** from the first contacts on this thing to a printed shell around it.

# I did not write a modem, and that is the whole trick

A PSK31 demodulator that beats fldigi's would be a multi-year project, and I would lose.

![width:1150px](img/modem-chain.png)

**XML-RPC** is one program calling functions inside another over HTTP. fldigi publishes a documented method list and keeps it stable across releases; the deck calls forty of them — `modem.set_by_name`, `main.set_frequency`, `text.add_tx`, `text.get_rx`. That makes it a supported client of fldigi, not a fork of it and not a screen-scrape.

**The loopback interface** is `127.0.0.1`, the machine talking to itself. The calls never reach a network card, nothing is open to the LAN, and there is no port to secure.

All of fldigi's signal processing. None of its interface.

# AI helps with faster code and better documentation practices

![width:940px](img/doc-first-cycle.svg)

Hobby time arrives as confetti: twenty minutes before dinner, an hour on a Sunday. What decides whether a project happens is how much progress fits inside one fragment — a text terminal for HF with 534 tests behind it was never going to happen otherwise.

**Then turn it against your own design.** Write down how it should work, ask for an analysis of the alternatives, and ask the question worth more than any of them: *does this design imply there are tools, techniques or facts I am not accounting for?*
