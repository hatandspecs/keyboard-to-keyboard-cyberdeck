"""The four monochrome schemes (design_doc.md §5.8).

Each is one hue on black, with a dim variant for the timestamp and callsign
columns. Monochrome means one hue, not one intensity.

Two paths to the color, because the deck and the development machine are not
the same thing:

* **A Linux virtual console** takes `OSC P` escape sequences, which redefine
  palette entries outright. That is what allows a true amber and a true Matrix
  green rather than the ANSI approximations of yellow and green, and it is why
  switching schemes costs four escape sequences rather than a repaint.
* **Anything else** — a terminal emulator over SSH, which is where this gets
  developed — falls back to the nearest of the eight ANSI colors. Deckard
  becomes yellow and loses its amber, which is a development compromise and
  not what the panel will show.

# Which palette entries to redefine on a Linux console.
#
# These are NOT free-choice slots. A curses color pair on the Linux console can
# only name entries 0-7 — entries 8-15 are reachable for a foreground only via
# A_BOLD, which the console implements by adding 8, and not at all for a
# background. So the two entries the console will actually land on for a given
# scheme are:
#
#     dim text      -> the ANSI index itself          (e.g. yellow = 3)
#     bright text   -> that index + 8, via A_BOLD     (e.g. 11)
#
# An earlier version redefined entries 8 and 9 instead, on the reasoning that
# nothing else uses them. Nothing else did — including this program, which
# drew with the ANSI index and never referenced them. Every scheme rendered as
# its ANSI approximation, and Deckard's amber came out as yellow.

# so ncurses skips them all — and fbcon resolved each glyph's color when it was
# drawn, so the old colors stay on screen. The symptom is unmistakable once
# seen: after switching to Hal, only the digits that happened to change value
# came out red, while the rest of the status bar stayed the previous scheme's
# green.
